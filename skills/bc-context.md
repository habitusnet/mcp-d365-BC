Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (BC) is a cloud ERP system built on the Microsoft platform. Its hierarchy has three distinct layers: the **Tenant** (your Azure AD / Entra ID organization, identified by a GUID), **Environments** (infrastructure deployments within that tenant), and **Companies** (isolated data containers within an environment). This distinction matters constantly in practice. An environment is a deployed BC instance — it has a name like "Production" or "Sandbox-UAT", it runs a specific BC version, and it can be started, stopped, copied, or upgraded as a unit. A company is purely a data boundary inside that environment: separate chart of accounts, separate customers, separate transactions. A single Production environment commonly hosts multiple companies — for example "Fabrikam Ltd" and "Fabrikam US Inc" — each fully isolated from the other.

The BC API URL encodes this hierarchy directly: `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/{tenantId}/{environmentName}/api/v2.0/companies({companyId})/`. Every data request targets a specific company within a specific environment. Getting the wrong company GUID returns the wrong data silently, so always confirm `BC_COMPANY` before running queries against unfamiliar environments.

Several accounting concepts appear repeatedly in BC work. **Posting groups** are codes that route transactions to the correct G/L accounts automatically — customer posting groups determine the receivables account, vendor posting groups the payables account, inventory posting groups the stock accounts. **Number series** (called "No. Series" in BC) auto-assign document numbers like invoice numbers and order numbers; they are per-company and must be configured before transactions can be posted. **Dimensions** are analytical tags (like Department, Project, or Cost Center) that attach to transactions for reporting without creating separate G/L accounts. **Fiscal periods** in BC are defined per-company: you open and close accounting periods explicitly, and posting to a closed period is blocked by default.

BC organizes financial data around the **chart of accounts** (G/L accounts), which are typed as Balance Sheet or Income Statement and grouped into categories and subcategories. The **general ledger entries** table is the ultimate source of truth — every posted document (sales invoice, purchase invoice, payment, journal) produces G/L entries. If a number looks wrong in a report, tracing back to G/L entries is almost always the right debugging move.

This plugin wires two MCP servers to cover different operational layers. Use **bc-admin** for anything infrastructural: managing environments, installing or updating apps, handling Per-Tenant Extensions (PTEs), controlling sessions, setting maintenance windows, or toggling feature flags. Use **bc-data** for anything involving business records: querying customers, vendors, items, invoices, purchase orders, G/L entries, or accounts. The rule of thumb is simple — if it would normally live in the BC admin center portal, use bc-admin; if it would live inside a BC company's data pages, use bc-data. Never use bc-admin to query customer balances, and never expect bc-data to know about environment-level settings.
